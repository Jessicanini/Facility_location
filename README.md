##  Explanation
this is the source code for the paper "A Novel Facility Location Problem for Taxi Hailing Platforms: A Two-stage Neighborhood Search Heuristic Approach"

#### These are the custom classes that exist in this project.

* DI.java	
* Driver.java	
* Facility.java
* Gps.java
* Point.java
* Point1.java	
* Routine.java

#### This is the class used to build the mixed integer programming using CPLEX solver 
* build_model1.java

#### These are classes used for Two-stage Neighborhood Search Heuristic Approach
* KM1.java (this class is used to realize the K-means method)
* heuristic_egas.java (this class defines the heuristic method)
* Solution_L2.java (this is the main class)
